## 🧠 Overview

**LympClear** is a deep learning–based framework developed to suppress venous signal interference in Magnetic Resonance Lymphangiography (MRL), significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy for **lower extremity lymphedema (LE)**. This project introduces a novel signal suppression approach, dynamic image generation pipeline, and a lymphatic development grading system to improve anatomical clarity and support clinical decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Background

MRL is widely used for LE diagnosis, but high-intensity venous signals often obscure lymphatic structures. LympClear solves this with a **brightness-matching enhanced nnUNet model**, enabling accurate vein suppression, improved visualization, and faster, more reliable interpretation.

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🧠 **Model**: Custom-trained nnUNet with brightness-matching strategy  
- 🧪 **Dataset**: 1022 patients, 6162 dynamic scans, multi-center, 2007–2024  
- 🎞 **Output**: Cleaned MRL, dynamic flow GIFs, structural grading  
- 📈 **Clinical Impact**: Faster reading, higher diagnostic consistency, more confident planning

1. **Input**: 3D dynamic MRL scans  
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalization, registration, manual vein annotation  
3. **Training**: nnUNet with brightness matching  
4. **Output**:  
   - Vein-free MRL images  
   - Dynamic contrast agent flow GIFs   
   - Lymphatic development grading

## 🧪 Lymphatic Development Grading System

> **Table x. Lymphatic Development Grading System**

| Grade       | Development Status     | Imaging Characteristics |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Grade I** | Aplasia                | Extremely sparse or nearly invisible lymphatic signals; maximum vessel diameter is very small (<2 mm), branching density approaches zero, with almost no abnormal collateral circulation. |
| **Grade II**| Hypoplasia             | Continuous lymph vessels <5, maximum diameter between 2–3 mm, slightly reduced branching density, only very few abnormal collateral vessels. Relatively low dilation rate (<10%). |
| **Grade III**| Hyperplasia           | Continuous lymph vessels >7, increased diameter (e.g., ≥4 mm), with alternating segments of significant dilation or narrowing; increased branching density and presence of multiple abnormal collateral vessels; moderate or higher dilation rate (≥30%). |
| **Grade IV**| Severe Hyperplasia     | Highly dilated or clustered tortuous vessels, maximum diameter possibly >6 mm or larger; extremely high branching density, abundant abnormal collateral circulation; very high dilation rate (e.g., ≥50%), often accompanied by severe clinical symptoms. |


### Grade I: Aplasia
![Grade I](zeromip_image_comparison_vein_10716_0000.nii.png)  
*Extremely sparse lymphatic signals, <2 mm in diameter, minimal branching.*

### Grade II: Hypoplasia
![Grade II](zeromip_image_comparison_vein_10394_0000.nii.png)  
*Sparse vessels, slight dilation (2–3 mm), few abnormal collaterals.*

### Grade III: Hyperplasia
![Grade III](zeromip_image_comparison_vein_10043_0000.nii.png)  
*Thickened and tortuous vessels (≥4 mm), moderate collaterals.*

### Grade IV: Severe Hyperplasia
![Grade IV](zeromip_image_comparison_vein_10897_0000.nii.png)  
*Severely dilated and clustered lymphatic network, extensive collateral flow.*
